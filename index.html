								<b>Unravelling the formation histories of distant quiescent galaxies using ultra-deep 
									spectroscopy</b><br>
								Fundamental insights into the chemical enrichment, assembly, and star formation
								histories of galaxies across cosmic time can be gained by examining the fossil records 
								encoded in their stellar populations.  Previously, 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917L...1B/abstract">
									Beverage et al. (2021)</a> and Beverage et al. (in prep). measured the integrated 
								chemical abundance patterns in a large sample of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) at 
								redshifts between 0.6 and 0.75 from the 
								<a href="https://users.ugent.be/~avdrwel/research.html#legac">LEGA-C</a> survey.  From these 
								results, we have learned fascinating new details about chemical enrichment regulation, star 
								formation timescales, and galaxy quenching.  However, the detailed star formation and assembly 
								histories of galaxies are imprinted in the spatial distributions of their chemical abundances.  
								We are currently working on measuring spatially-resolved stellar population parameters in the 
								LEGA-C ETGs by employing the <a href="https://github.com/cconroy20/alf">alf</a> models over 
								different apertures.  alf is a suite of full-spectrum stellar population synthesis models that 
								simultaneously fit for ages, metallicities, and detailed chemical abundances.<br><br>
								
								In the near future, we will apply the methods that we develop with the LEGA-C data to our
								approved 
								<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2110">
									Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program</a>.  We will obtain deep rest-frame optical 
								spectra of quiescent and star-forming galaxies, extending this analysis to higher 
								redshifts (between 1.0 and 2.5).  We will additionally be able to combine this with data 
								from the <a href="https://heavymetal.astro.berkeley.edu/">Heavy Metal survey</a>, which 
								contains ultra-deep spectra of 20 quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.3 to 2.3.  Together,
								these three datasets will provide a deeper understanding of the formation histories of 
								quiescent galaxies over ~5 Gyr of cosmic time.<br><br>
								
								Stay tuned for new results coming soon!

								<b>Testing the extremes of initial mass function variability using compact stellar
								systems</b><br>
								A fundamental concept underpinning star formation and galaxy evolution studies is the 
								distribution of birth stellar masses in a galaxy, called the initial mass function 
								(IMF).  Traditionally, most studies have assumed that the IMF is "universal", because 
								measurements made via the direct method of resolved star counts in the Milky Way and in
								nearby star-forming regions have found little-to-no variation.  This assumption
								has been challenged by increasingly detailed, indirect measurements in diverse,
								extragalactic stellar populations.  However, observations of variations in the IMF
								with environment are still debated, since there is still not a satisfactory
								theoretical framework to explain this.  <br><br>
								
								A key limitation is that observations thus far have only probed metal-rich ETGs, which 
								encompass a narrow region of mass-metallicity-density parameter space.  In this work,
								we observe the integrated light spectra of diverse objects, including "compact" stellar
								systems (i.e. globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies) and brightest cluster
								galaxies.  We sample a wide range of metallicities (-1.7 < [Fe/H] < 0.01) and velocity
								dispersions (between 7.4 km/s and 275 km/s).  We reduce high S/N Keck LRIS spectra.  We 
								measure the IMF by fitting the spectra with the 
								<a href="https://github.com/cconroy20/alf">alf</a> models, which allow for IMF
								variations.  This is a follow-up study to 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850L..14V/abstract">
									Villaume et al. (2017)</a><br><br>
								
								We show that compact stellar systems do not follow the same trends with physical 
								parameters that have been found for ETGs (shown in the Figure above).  In particular, 
								we find that previously established trends between metallicity and IMF variation may 
								change in complex ways.<br><br>
								
								This paper is currently in preparation, stay tuned for the link!

								<b>Testing the chemical homogeneity of chemically-tagged dissolved birth clusters</b>
								<br>
								Chemically tagging stars back to common formation sites in the Milky Way is crucial
								for understanding the chemical and dynamical history of the Galactic disc.  In 
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5101P/abstract">
									Price-Jones et al. (2020)</a>, 21 dissolved birth clusters were found in the 
								APOGEE survey, by blindly chemically tagging an eight-dimensional chemical space using 
								the Density-Based Spatial Clustering Applications with Noise algorithm (DBSCAN).  In
								this work, we constrain the intrinsic abundance scatter in 17 of these groups.  We do
								this by modeling the stellar spectra as a one-dimensional function of initial stellar 
								mass, forward modeling the observed spectra, and comparing the data and the models
								using Approximate Bayesian Computation.  We test the method on the well-studied open
								clusters M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 6791, using data from 
								<a href="https://personal.tcu.edu/pfrinchaboy/Research_occam.html">OCCAM</a> 
								(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..142D/abstract">Donor et al. 
								2018</a>).  In general, we are able to 
								strongly constrain the 15 elements that we examine.  This strengthens the statement that these 
								groups of stars represent birth clusters.<br><br>
